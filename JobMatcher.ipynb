Multivariate Analysis: Handling high dimensional data and performing PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Clustering, both theoretically and in R.    Statistical Inference: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.     Monk’s Walk Sixth Form - Hertfordshire, UK                                                                         A-Levels  Further Mathematics (A*), Mathematics (A*), Chemistry (C)      Technical Skills   • Python: Proficient in data manipulation, supervised & unsupervised machine learning, using APIs and numerical methods. Experienced with Jupyter Notebook and libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and SerpApi.  • R: Proficient in regression models, hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques such as PCA and clustering. Skilled in data manipulation, visualisation and analysis using the tidyverse suite.   • Data Visualisation: Expertise in visualising data using libraries such as Matplotlib in Python and ggplot2 and factoextra in R.  • Languages: Highly skilled in French speaking, reading and writing developed in Interfaculty French Level 3 and Level 4. Conversational proficiency in German handling day to day interactions well and a developing knowledge of Arabic.    Projects  Data Science Project – Grade: 100%  Analysed a United Nations data set to explore the economic and health indicators of various countries using machine learning and multivariate analysis techniques in R.  • PCA: Plotting and interpreting principal components to understand the similarities between countries by GDP and life expectancy.   • Clustering: Assessing whether k-means, model based or hierarchical clustering methods yielded the best results in classifying countries based on GDP and life expectancy.   • Linear Discriminant Analysis: Predicting continent based on GDP, life expectancy and population data and assessing the predictive accuracy using a confusion matrix.   • Regression: Building a linear model using OLS, principal component and ridge regression to predict life expectancy in 2007 and determine which method gave the most accurate model.  Job Matcher Machine Learning Algorithm  Developed a program in Python that matches job descriptions with CVs using machine learning, outputting a table of jobs with the highest percentage matches. Using Jupyter Notebook to provide real-time updates to the table as new data was streamed from the API.  • APIs: Developed my knowledge of APIs by using SerpApi to web scrape data from Google Jobs to input into my machine learning algorithm.   • Machine Learning: Improved machine learning skills by learning text similarity algorithms and developed my understanding of Scikit-learn library.  • Future plans include developing this project into an NLP based application to improve the accuracy of the percentage match.  Final Year Applied Mathematical Modelling Group Projects - Grade 74%  Project 1: Modelling Javelin Trajectories, Project 2: Modelling Bumper Car Dynamics, Project 3: Modelling Spontaneous Ignition.   • Python Skills: Applied object-oriented programming to solve differential equations using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method and the Finite Difference Method.  • Machine Learning: Employing machine learning polynomial regression to predict the flight path in project one, using Sci-kit learn, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.  • Mathematical Report Writing: Following a model, analysis, results (MAR) structure to show our findings clearly and effectively.  • Presentation: Presenting our project results to a large audience, ensuring complex ideas were understandable to various mathematical levels.    Experience   U-Cycle Business Development Officer and Operations Advisor - Enactus Nottingham, 2024  • 1000% increase in reach on Instagram by managing and developing relationships between societies and companies, contributing to a £1400 increase in revenue since the previous year.  • Refined leadership skills while organising a competition in collaboration with an engineering society, engaging 50 participants and hosting multiple events including a final judging panel event.  • Performed analysis on CO2 emissions while running a social media campaign with sustainability society to promote Ucycle’s environmental benefits.  • Advised operational decisions including supplier selection, pricing negotiation and cost analysis.    Great British Cycling Team Cyclist – UK, 2019 - 2021  • Transferred Athletic Discipline built by working towards challenging goals and understanding the importance of the long game to my academic studies.  • Balanced training, travel and education developing my time management skills.   • Analysed Real Data from training by identifying patterns, allowing me to make informed decisions around training progress.   • Performed at the Highest Level and Succeeded under Pressure, highlighted by a European Bronze medal in the 1km time trial in 2021\""

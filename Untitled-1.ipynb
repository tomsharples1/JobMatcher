Theoretically and in R.   Multivariate Analysis: Handling high dimensional data and performing PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Clustering theoretically and in R.    Statistical Inference: Applying Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo to draw insights and make informed decisions from data.   Exam grade (89%)      Monk’s Walk Sixth Form – Hertfordshire, UK                                                                       Sept 2019-May 2021  A-Levels                                                                                                             Subjects: Further Mathematics (A*), Mathematics (A*), Chemistry (C)      Technical Skills   • Proficient in Python with expertise in numerical methods, web scraping using APIs and data frame manipulation, utilising Jupyter Notebook and libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Sci-kit learn, SerpApi and Pandas.  • Experienced in R programming using linear regression, hypothesis testing, performing PCA, clustering and data visualisation using libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr and factoextra.  • Highly skilled in French speaking, reading and writing developed in Interfaculty French Level 3 and Level 4.     Projects  Watts2speed App - 2022  Working with GB podium cyclists to develop an app that enables them to determine their speed based on their power output.   • Combined cycling and mathematical knowledge to build an initial app in Python.  • Rapidly adapted to C#, Xaml, and .NET Maui after realising the mobile interface limitations of Python.  • Tested using real data provided by my friend Josh Charlton’s to verify the output’s accuracy.  • Resulted in an app that opened discussions on watt savings and their corresponding speed gains. Enabled precise pacing calculations and required power outputs for specific target times. This placed Josh 2nd at the 2022 European Championships for Individual Pursuit and 6th at the 2023 World Time Trial Championships.  Applied Mathematical Modelling Group Projects – 2024  Project 1: Modelling Javelin Trajectories, Project 2: Modelling Bumper Car Dynamics, Project 3: Modelling Spontaneous Ignition.   • Proficiently developed Python skills and applied object-oriented programming to solve differential equations using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method and the Finite Difference Method.  • Employed machine learning polynomial regression for flight path prediction in project one, using Sci-kit learn, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.  • Mathematical report writing following a model, analysis, results (MAR) structure to show our findings clearly and effectively.  • Presented project results to a large audience, ensuring complex ideas were understandable to various mathematical levels.      Experience   U-Cycle Business Development Officer - Enactus Nottingham – 2024  • 1000% increase in reach on Instagram by managing and developing relationships between societies and companies, contributing to a £1400 increase in revenue since the previous year.  • Refined leadership skills while organising a competition in collaboration with an engineering society, engaging 50 participants and hosting multiple events including a final judging panel event.  • Performed analysis on CO2 emissions while running a social media campaign with sustainability society to promote Ucycle’s environmental benefits.  • Advised operational decisions including supplier selection, pricing negotiation and cost analysis.    Great British Cycling Team Cyclist – UK – 2019-2021  • Transferred athletic discipline built by working towards challenging goals and understanding the importance of the long game to my academic studies.  • Balanced training, travel and education developing my time management skills.   • Analysed real data from training by identifying patterns, allowing me to make informed decisions around training progress.   • Performed at the highest level and succeeded under pressure, highlighted by a European Bronze medal in the 1km time trial in 2021.\""
